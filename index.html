                    <p>Since graduating from the University of the West of Scotland two years ago where I obtained a BSc with
                        First Class Honours in Computer Games Development, I have been working as a Unity developer. My current
                        role has seen me work on a number of existing and new mobile applications, where I have been responsible
                        for both the design and development of these applications.</p>

                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy creating my own games and applications, which has seen me release a small number
                        of games on the Google Play store and Amazon App Store. I also enjoy taking part in game jams and
                        following along with various online courses/tutorials to help boost my skills and knowledge.</p>

                        access a digital version of their library card as well as other various features. Planet Library
                        also includes a game hunt feature that allows children to explore their local libraries and find
                        and collect different characters and creatures to unlock various different games.</p>

                    <p>A First Person Shooter that I developed as an example violent video game for participants of my research
                        to play in order to ensure they were being exposed to a game with violent content.</p>

                        alone on it and was responsible for creating all of the code for the game. To help me develop the
                        game I made use of some teaching books for Unity as well as referencing the Unity API for more details,
                        especially since I had such a short development window.</p>

                    <p>While developing the game I wanted to use the same method that AAA games such as Battlefield use for
                        the shooting. For this reason all of the shooting in the game is done with Raycasting. When the player
                        shoots a Raycast is created from the middle off the camera and is shot out infinitely. Once that
                        is done a RaycastHit is then shot out along the Raycast and sends a “detectHit” message to any object
                        it hits. When the “detectHit” message is read by the enemy’s damage is applied to them by reducing
                        its health. Once the message is sent to the hit objects a particle script is run to play particle
                        effects. If the tag of the hit object equals “enemy” a blood splatter effect is then played and if
                        the object is tagged with “MetalObject” and metal spark particle effect is played on the position
                        of the object hit.</p>

                    <p>The enemies in the game also use Unity’s navigation system in order to path find to predetermined locations.
                        To do this a navigation mesh was created by the engine by calculating the geometry of the map. Empty
                        objects that act as points for each of the enemies were then placed in the level and placed into
                        an array for each of the enemy’s navigation script in order to know what waypoints to move to. The
                        enemy movement code then moves to the first waypoint in the array until it has reached it then selects
                        the next waypoint and keeps cycling through the array. The enemies are also told to take a pause
                        once they have reach each waypoint and will also stop moving if the player is within range of them
                        or if the player shoots at them. The enemies will also shoot back at the player using the same Recasting
                        method that the player uses.</p>

                    <h1>The Edge of Civilization</h1>
                    <hr>

                    <p>The Edge of Civilization is a First Person survival game created in the Unreal 4 Engine as part of my
                        3D Level Design Class at University.</p>

                    <iframe width="374" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56GOOdiHXV8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>The class involved us working in teams of two to design and create a level for a game. The initial idea
                        for the game was proposed by me then the team built on this idea to polish the idea for the game
                        out. As no one on the team was familiar with C++ and because we only had 6 weeks to create the game
                        after spending the first 6 weeks on the design document, the team opted to use Unreal’s Blueprint
                        system. My roles in the team were to work on the design document, act as the Team Leader and do all
                        of the coding for the game as I was the strongest programmer out of the team.</p>

                    <p>During the project I learned how to use the engine's level creation tools to help my team mate build
                        the structure of the level before starting to work on the interactivity. The game features a number
                        of interactivity from using Trigger Boxes to change the brightness of lights to give the light a
                        flickering on effect, making objects disappear and playing voice over audio when interacting with
                        objects in the level. The game also features two enemies that use Unreal’s Navmesh in order to path
                        find to the player and chase them through the level. Doing this simple required me to place a Navmesh
                        object on the first and second floor of the level then call a Simple Move to Actor function in the
                        blueprint of the enemies.</p>

                    <iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/66495?dark=true" width="208" height="167"></iframe>

                    <p>I also decided to add in level streaming to the game so that the only floor of the level that is loaded
                        at any time is the one the player is on. Even though the game is not that large or intensive I felt
                        that this was a good thing to implement as it gives me experience on always optimising games for
                        the players experience and reinforces the learning of optimising your games for players. Once the
                        player gets in the elevator to change floor the a blueprint that detects what floor the player is
                        currently on before unloading it and loading in the new floor is called once the elevator door is
                        closed. I also decided to add in subtitles for all of the voice over in the game as I am a fan of
                        turning subtitles on whenever I play games and it was something that I wanted to gain experience
                        with. I also got some more practice with using particles in this game as I created two different
                        particle effects, one was for the smoke at the intro sequence of the game and the second was running
                        water in the shower room of the game where the player is chased by the first enemy.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>The Dead of Night is a 2D survival top down shooter where the player must continually kill zombies in
                        order to survive through as many waves as possible, each time the player shoots or kills a zombie
                        they are given money which they can use to buy weapons scattered around the level Once the player
                        has been killed they have the ability to spend any money left over on upgrades to their health, amount
                        of ammo given and damage to help them survive even longer against larger hordes.</p>

                    <iframe width="374" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxLbDz-aWiM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>The game was created as part of my HTML5 and JavaScript Game’s class at university, the class was planned
                        for groups of two people to work on the project but I worked on it alone. We were tasked with designing
                        a game to be created with the Phaser.IO framework and the game also had to store player information
                        to an SQL database, as well as creating a website to host out design documentation and the game itself.
                        When creating the website I decided to use the Bootstrap framework so I could easily and quickly
                        create a fully functional website with some more advanced features. The main parts of the Bootstrap
                        framework I used was its Navbar to create the website's navigation, I used the carousel so I could
                        easily display a number of in game screenshots and its grid system to easily and clearly format information
                        on various pages of the site.</p>

                    <p>In regards to the game itself I used a number of Phaser.IO features such as its state manager to easily
                        change between levels, scale manager to resize the game window, its ability to load atlas and JSON
                        files and access images by filename, ensuring all of the game's audio has been decoded before starting
                        the game and the ability to create groups for creating multiple objects instantly. During the project
                        I also got to work with particles for a second time which helped me gain more knowledge and experience
                        in working with particle systems.</p>

                    <iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/49447?dark=true" width="208" height="167"></iframe>

                    <p>For the collision and movement in my game I used the Phaser.IO arcade physics system. To move objects
                        around using the arcade physics I had to add to or subtract from their X and Y velocity, the collision
                        features I made use of was the arcade physics collide and the arcade physics overlap. The collide
                        form of physics was used for instance to stop the player from walking through or on top of walls,
                        were as the overlap form of physics was used to allow the players bullets to go over the zombies
                        collision box before dealing damage to make it look more natural. The game also makes use of Phaser.IO
                        ability to read JSON files created with the Tiled level editor software to quickly create the levels
                        using a JSON data file and images of the tiles used in Tiled.</p>

                    <p>This was the first time I have worked with PHP and SQL both saving and pulling information from a database
                        and I have learned a lot about this. When the player starts the game they are asked to enter a username
                        and password which is then used to check if the players data has been previously stored in the database.
                        If their information has been found I create a number of substrings to store their damage, ammo and
                        health upgrade variable values to use in the game. If the player’s information has not been found
                        however their information is then sent to the database so they can retrieve their upgrades next time
                        they play. When the player increases the value of any of their upgrades, the values of these upgrades
                        are increased in the database by finding their old value using the player's username and password
                        and updating them with their new values.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>This is a 2D tower defence game inspired by Plants vs Zombies that was created for my Games Project:
                        Design and Plan and Games Project: Creating Game classes at University. The game was created by a
                        team which consisted of me and one other member.</p>

                    <iframe width="374" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hu_7AmXWpWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>My role in the team was to act as Team leader, designer, technical documenter and programmer for both
                        classes. The game was created in the Unity IDE and is running on the Unity 5 engine. I decided to
                        use C# as the programming language, as this gave me the most power compared to using JavaScript or
                        UnityScript, the Design and Plan class seen us create a design and technical document as well as
                        Gantt charts covering all the details of the game as well as the development time frame. Information
                        on the story, target audience, target devices, required hardware and software as well as information
                        on the IDE/Engine and programming language we would be using and much more information was included
                        in these documents.</p>

                    <p>In the Creating Game class we had to create a small demo of the game as well as coming up with testing
                        and dissemination strategies, complete a development log and state the coding practices and standards
                        used. The game uses Unity’s UI components to create the main menu, win/loss screen and the pause
                        menus within the game; I also used Linecasting in order to detect if any turrets were in front of
                        the enemies to stop them from moving. Another time I used Linecasting was to check if any enemy objects
                        are within range to the turrets so that the turrets can shoot at them.</p>

                    <p>The game also features collision detection using Box Colliders 2D and Rigidbodies in order to check if
                        the projectiles and or mines collide with the enemy objects. Audio sources are also featured within
                        the game to play background music and sound effects. PlayerPrefs are also used to save the last level
                        the player reached so that they can continue their game, they are also used for saving if the audio
                        was disabled or enabled the last time the user played the game. As the game is targeted for mobiles
                        devices the users also have the ability to share their score on Twitter, which links our personal
                        account so others can see it and they can also rate the game.</p>

                    <h1>World Cup Manager</h1>
                    <hr>

                    <p>World Cup manager was created as part of a three man team for our computer project class, our brief was
                        to create a piece of software from a list as part of a random team of people that do not know each
                        other. My team decided to make a mobile application that allowed people to save game outcomes about
                        the world cup and have it update tables and outcomes.</p>

                    <p>The application displays the matches to be played in the tournament and then takes in user input of score
                        from each game. Once the scores have been entered the application will update the group stages by
                        filling in the points, goals, goal difference and other information to the group tables. After the
                        group stage the application displays the knockout stages and once again it takes a score input and
                        will graphically display which teams move on further into the tournament. It can also be used to
                        simulate made up outcomes in a world cup situation and can also be used for future tournaments as
                        well. During the tournament the application had over ten thousand downloads with our highest daily
                        download total hitting 250.</p>

                    <p>My role is the team was to get resources, compile minutes of meeting and help with half of the documentation;
                        my main task was to create 75 of the 100 flags that could be used in a world cup tournament as no
                        good quality version of these flags were available for download. I had a lot of fun designing and
                        creating the application as well as learning a lot making it, it was a challenge at first to make
                        such an application in a short period of time with people I have never spoken to before but I feel
                        the outcome of the final product was fantastic.</p>
