            Hello, Iâ€™m Daniel Taylor a software engineer based in Scotland. I
            enjoy creating things for desktop, mobile and the web using
            technologies like C#, JavaScript and React. I Graduated from the
            University of the West of Scotland a few years ago with a BSc.
            Honours in Computer Games Development.
            </p>

          <p>
            Shortly after graduating from university, I started my
            professional career working as a Unity developer for two years.
            Before switching things up and working as a fullstack developer
            over the third year of my career.
