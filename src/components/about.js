              Since graduating from the University of the West of Scotland two
              years ago where I obtained a BSc with First Class Honours in
              Computer Games Development, I have been working as a Unity
              developer. My current role has seen me work on a number of
              existing and new mobile applications, where I have been
              responsible for both the design and development of these
              applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I enjoy creating my own games and applications,
              which has seen me release a small number of games on the Google
              Play store and Amazon App Store. I also enjoy taking part in game
              jams and following along with various online courses/tutorials to
              help boost my skills and knowledge.
