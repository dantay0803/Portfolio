(URL in the comments)</a> from      <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/\">webdev</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src=\"https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After seeing it I thought the project and project idea was really cool and thought it would be fun to have a go at trying to recreate it myself using <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>. A side objective I had was to also try and recreate the CSS as much as I could without inspecting the elements on their page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part the project went a lot smoother than I had expected, with most of my time on it being taken up by the CSS and the calendar integration. I have worked on a number of personal react projects and one  professional project before and think this did help make it easier than I initially thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first things I done for the project which was different from my usual working method, was setting out most of the properties in the projects state. I do think being able to do this early on was helped by having a clear end goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After around 5-6 hours work I had the application nearly complete. All it was missing was the calendar integration, which if I had left out or swapped to outputing a text file would have saved a bit of time. But I am glad I didn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My original plan was to use Google Calendar just like  <a href=\"https://www.log-time.com/login\">Log Time</a> did, but I did hit a bit of a road block. The trouble with using  Google Calendar was that I would need my application to be checked and authorized by Google before I could access a users data. As this was a personal project that will not be released and having no experience with how long that would take, I decided to leave it and check out my other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to checkout integrating the application with a users Outlook calendar, I decided to try this approach. After a bit of Google-fu I found <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph\">Microsoft Graph</a>, that has a selection of APIs developers can use to access user data. Then once I played around with it and felt it fit my needs well, I found the video below showing you how to get completely set up and start using it in your own project.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Build React SPA&#039;s with Microsoft Graph - June 2019\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IghiKqly-HY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-reactspa\">GitHub repository</a> also has the source code for the video above and a lot of other useful code. Once I had the API calls in place and it was working with some static data, all I had to do was update the POST call with my actual data and spend some time on a nice Login page to ask the user for their account access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On my final day of working on the project I decided to expand my idea just a little and add a button that would allow users to add new tasks. Thankfully I found this tutorial on <a href=\"https://dev.to/achowba/building-a-modal-in-react-15hg\">creating a modal in react</a> from dev.to which helped when I got stuck with creating my own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally. You can see the working version of the application in the gif below and if you fancy a look at the source code you can fit it on <a href=\"https://github.com/dantay0803/React_Projects/tree/master/timetracker\">GitHub</a> (but beware it can still use some cleaning up). Overall I really enjoyed working on the project and want to give another shutout and thanks to the team at  <a href=\"https://www.log-time.com/login\">Log Time</a> for sharing this, and giving me an enjoyable side project to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://danielt.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TimeTracker-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-231\"/></figure>\n","featuredImage":{"altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://danielt.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TimeTracker-1.gif"}},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"date":"2019-09-14T16:39:11","slug":"student-employment-advice-presentation-2019","featuredImage":{"altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://danielt.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190913_141806-Copy.jpg"},"excerpt":"<p>A few months ago I was invited back to the university I used to attend, the University of the West of Scotland.
